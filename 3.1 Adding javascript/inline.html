<!--It only shows the alert message only when the body is loading with any comment( at least one comment)
  and then when u refresh the browser then the alert message will appear.
   if we use double quotes for both the alert and hello then the browser will get confused , that's why we use two different quote to show the difference
   as the comment after onload should be between quotes-->
